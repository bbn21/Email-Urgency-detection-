# Email-Urgency-detection

## INTRODUCTION
Python is a popular programming language that has a wide range of applications in different fields. One of the key areas where Python excels is in natural language processing (NLP). NLP involves the use of computational techniques to analyze, understand, and generate human language. Python's NLP libraries provide a powerful and flexible toolkit for working with language data.

Email communication is one of the most widely used forms of communication in today's digital age. With the advent of technology, emails have become a primary mode of communication for individuals and businesses alike. Emails are used for various purposes, ranging from formal communication to casual conversation. However, not all emails are equally important or urgent.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The problem statement for this project is to develop a system for automatically detecting the level of urgency in emails. In today's fast-paced world, email has become the primary mode of communication for many individuals and organizations. However, with the volume of emails received every day, it can be challenging to identify which emails require immediate attention and which ones can be addressed at a later time.

This problem is especially prevalent in a professional setting, where time-sensitive emails can have a significant impact on business operations. For example, missing an urgent email from a client or a colleague can result in missed opportunities or delayed responses, which can have negative consequences on business relationships and overall performance.

To address this problem, the project aims to develop an email urgency detection system that can classify emails based on their level of urgency. The system will be designed to automatically analyze the contents of an email and assign it a score that indicates its level of urgency. This will help individuals and organizations to prioritize their email communication and ensure that time-sensitive emails are identified and addressed promptly.

## OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY
The objective of this study is to develop an email urgency detection system that can accurately classify emails whether they are urgent or not. The system will use machine learning algorithms and NLP techniques to analyze the content of the email and determine its urgency level.

## WHAT IS EMAIL URGENCY DETECTION?
Email urgency detection is a process of analyzing the content of an email to determine its urgency level. The urgency level can be classified as urgent or not urgent. The purpose of email urgency detection is to help users prioritize their emails based on their importance, thereby saving time and improving productivity.

The primary objective of this project is to develop an email urgency detection model that can automatically identify the urgency level of an email. This project will involve using machine learning algorithms and techniques to analyze the content of emails and classify them based on their urgency level. It will enable users to focus on important emails first and reduce the time spent on less urgent emails. Additionally, businesses can use email urgency detection to prioritize their customer inquiries and ensure timely responses.

## THE IMPORTANCE OF SENTIMENT ANALYSIS IN EMAIL URGENCY DETECTION
Sentiment analysis is a key component of email urgency detection. Sentiment analysis involves the use of computational techniques to identify and extract opinions, emotions, and attitudes from text. 

In the context of email urgency detection, sentiment analysis can help to identify emails that contain urgent or time-sensitive information. For example, an email that contains negative sentiment or urgent language such as "please respond ASAP" may be more important than an email that contains neutral or positive sentiment.

Sentiment analysis can also help to identify emails that contain complaints or issues that require immediate attention. By analyzing the sentiment of emails, businesses can prioritize their responses and ensure that urgent issues are addressed promptly.

## NLP VS. TRADITIONAL EMAIL PRIORITIZATION METHODS
NLP offers several advantages over traditional email prioritization methods. One of the most significant advantages is its ability to adapt to different contexts and user needs. Traditional email prioritization methods, such as sorting emails by sender or subject line, are often inflexible and cannot be customized to meet specific needs.

Another advantage of NLP is its accuracy. Machine learning algorithms can learn from vast amounts of data, allowing them to identify patterns and make predictions with high levels of accuracy. Additionally, NLP can take into account a wide range of features, such as sentiment, tone, and context, which can provide a more accurate picture of email urgency than traditional methods.

## DATA COLLECTION & PROCESSING
Collecting and processing data is a crucial step in any NLP project. In the case of email prioritization, the first step is to collect a dataset of emails that can be used to train the machine learning model. The dataset should include a mix of urgent and non-urgent emails, as well as emails that are ambiguous in terms of urgency.

Once the dataset has been collected, it must be pre-processed to extract relevant features for the machine learning model. This can involve tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and stop word removal. Additionally, the data may need to be labeled to indicate the urgency of each email.

In this project we have taken 56 sample emails to perform email urgency detection, The emails are labeled as urgent and not urgent, and then we created a data frame using the sample mail 

## MODEL TRAINING & TESTING
In our project, we aimed to develop a machine-learning model capable of accurately classifying emails as either urgent or non-urgent. We accomplished this by training a natural language processing (NLP) model on a labeled data frame 

Using Python and sci-kit-learn, we pre-processed our dataset and converted the text into numerical features using the Bag of Words technique. We then split the dataset into training and testing sets, with a ratio of 80:20.

Next, we trained a logistic regression model using the training set. Logistic regression is a popular algorithm used for binary classification problems, which models the probability of an email being urgent based on its features.

Once the model was trained, we evaluated its performance on the testing set. We used several metrics, including precision and ROC AUC score, to evaluate the model's performance.

Our logistic regression model achieved good performance, with a precision of 1.0, indicating that all the positive predictions were true positives. The confusion matrix showed that the model made only one false negative and no false positives. The accuracy was 0.83, and the ROC AUC score was 0.625. These results demonstrate that our model can accurately classify urgent and non-urgent emails.

## RESULTS FROM THE PROJECT
The model's performance was evaluated using various metrics, including a confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, and ROC AUC score. The confusion matrix shows the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. In this case, the matrix has two rows and two columns. The rows represent the actual classes, while the columns represent the predicted classes.

In the first row, there are four true positives and zero false negatives. This means that out of the four urgent emails, the model correctly identified all of them as urgent. In the second row, there is one true negative and one false positive. This means that out of the two non-urgent emails, the model correctly identified one as non-urgent and misclassified one as urgent.

The model's overall accuracy was 0.833, which means it correctly classified 83.3% of the emails in the test set. The precision of the model was 1.0, which means that out of all the emails predicted as urgent, all of them were actually urgent. The ROC AUC score was 0.625, which indicates the model's ability to distinguish between the positive and negative classes. These results suggest that the model performed well in classifying emails as either urgent or non-urgent.

## CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the project aimed to detect the urgency level of emails using natural language processing techniques. The approach utilized in this study was to classify the emails into two categories, urgent and not urgent, based on their content. 

The model's performance was evaluated using various metrics, including a confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, and ROC AUC score. The confusion matrix showed that out of the four non-urgent emails, the model correctly identified all of them as non-urgent, and out of the two urgent emails, the model correctly identified one as urgent and misclassified the other as non-urgent.

The model's overall accuracy was 83.33%, indicating that the model correctly classified 83.33% of the emails in the test set. The precision of the model was 100%, meaning that out of all the emails predicted as urgent, all were actually urgent. The ROC AUC score was 0.625, indicating that the model's ability to distinguish between the positive and negative classes was moderate.

The model performed well, with high accuracy and precision, and a relatively low number of false positives and false negatives. However, the ROC AUC score indicates that there is still room for improvement in the model's ability to distinguish between the positive and negative classes. Further experimentation and refinement of the model may lead to improved performance in the future.
